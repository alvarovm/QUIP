QUIP and quippy documentation
=============================

.. module:: quippy

The ``QUIP`` package (`GitHub <https://github.com/libAtoms/QUIP>`_) is a
collection of software tools to carry out molecular dynamics
simulations. It implements a variety of interatomic potentials and
tight binding quantum mechanics, and is also able to call external
packages, and serve as plugins to other software such as `LAMMPS
<http://lammps.sandia.gov>`_, `CP2K <http://www.cp2k.org>`_ and also
the python framework `ASE <https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase>`_.  Various
hybrid combinations are also supported in the style of QM/MM, with a
particular focus on materials systems such as metals and
semiconductors.

``quippy`` is a Python interface to ``QUIP`` that provides deep access to
most of the Fortran types and routines. The quippy interface is principally
maintained by `James Kermode <http://www.warwick.ac.uk/jrkermode>`_.

Long term support of the package is ensured by:
 - Noam Bernstein (Naval Research Laboratory)
 - Gabor Csanyi (University of Cambridge)
 - James Kermode (University of Warwick)
